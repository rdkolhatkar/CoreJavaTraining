1) What is CPU (Central Processing Unit)?
-> Often referred as brain of computer, is responsible for executing instructions from programs.
   It performs basic arithmatic, logic, control and input/output operations specified by instructions
   Examples: A modern CPU like the Intel Core i7 or AMD Ryzen 7
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) What is core?
-> A core is an individual processing unit within a CPU.
   Modern CPUs can have multiple cores, allowing them to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
   A quad-core processor has four cores, allowing it to perform four tasks simultaneously.
   For instance, one core could handle your web browser, another your music player, another a download manager and another a background system update.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) What is a program?
-> A program is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer how to perform a specific task
   Example, Microsoft Word is a program that allows users to create and edit documents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) What is a process?
-> A process is an instance of a program that is being executed. When a program runs, the operating system creates a process to manage its execution.
   Example, When we open Microsoft Word, it becomes a process in the operating system.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) What is Thread?
-> A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can have multiple threads, which share the same resources but can run independently.
   Example: A web browser like Google Chrome might use multiple threads for different tabs, with each tab running as a separate thread.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6) What is Multitasking?
-> Multitasking allows an operating system to run multiple processes simultaneously. On single-core CPUs, this is done through time-sharing, rapidly switching between tasks.
   On multi-core CPUs, true parallel execution occurs, with tasks distributed across cores. The OS scheduler balances the load, ensuring efficient and responsive system performance.
   Multitasking utilizes the capabilities of a CPU and its core. When an operating system performs multitasking, it can assign different tasks to different cores.
   This is more efficient than assigning all tasks to a single core.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7) What is Multithreading?
-> Multithreading refers to the ability to execute multiple threads within a single process concurrently.
   Multithreading enhances the efficiency of multitasking by breaking down individual tasks into smaller sub-tasks or threads.
   These threads can be processed simultaneously, making better use of the CPU's capabilities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: I) In a single-core system, both threads and processes are managed by the OS schedular through time slicing and context switching to create the illusion of simultaneous execution.
      II) In a multi-core system, Both threads and processes can run in true parallel on different cores, with OS schedular distributing tasks across the cores to optimize performance.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8) What is Time Slicing
-> Time Slicing divides CPU time into smaller intervals called time slices or quanta.
   OS Schedular allocates these time slices to different processes and threads, ensuring each gets a fair share of CPU time.
   This prevents any single process or thread from monopolizing the CPU, improving responsiveness and enabling concurrent execution.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9) What is context switching?
-> Context switching is the process of saving the state of a currently running process or thread and loading the state of the next one to be executed.
   When a process or thread's time slice expires, the OS schedular performs a context switch to move to the CPU's focus to another process or thread.
   This allows multiple processes and threads to share the CPU, giving the appearance of simultaneous execution on a single CPU (or single processor/core).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10) What is Multithreading in Java?
-> In Java, multithreading is the concurrent execution of two or more threads to maximize the utilization of the CPU.
   Java's multithreading capabilities are part of the 'java.lang' package making it easy to implement concurrent execution.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: I) In single-core environment, Java's multithreading is managed by the JVM and the OS, which switch between threads to give the illusion of concurrency.
         The threads share the single core, and time-slicing is used to manage thread execution.
      II) In multi-core environment, Java's multithreading can take full advantage of the available cores.
          The JVM can distribute threads across multiple cores allowing true parallel execution of threads.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: I) A thread is a lightweight process, the smallest unit of processing. Java supports multithreading through its 'java.lang.Thread' class and
         the 'java.lang.Runnable' interface
      II) When a Java program starts, one thread begins running immediately, which is called the main thread. This thread is responsible for executing the main method of a program.
      III) To create a new thread in Java, you have to either extend the Thread class or implement the Runnable interface.
