/**
 In a Fibonacci series, the value of any term is the sum of the values of the last two terms.
 For example, if we want to compute the 3rd term of the series, then it is the sum of the 1st and the 2nd term.
 Note that the first two terms of the Fibonacci series are defined as 0 and 1. Thus, the 3rd term will be 0 + 1 = 1.
 The 4th term will be the sum of the 3rd and the 2nd terms, 1 + 1 = 2.
 The 5th term will be the sum of the 4th and the 3rd term, which is 2 + 1 = 3.
 Thus the Fibonacci series looks like the following.
 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, â€¦ (considering 1 - indexing)
 Therefore, in general, the nth term of the series can be written as
 F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)

 Now, we can write the program for computing the nth term of the Fibonacci series as follows.
 Note that the value of n will be provided by the user.
